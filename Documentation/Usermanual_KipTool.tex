\section{Introduction}

\section{Node locked software}
KipTool is free of charge and I intend to keep it so. But, since I want to have control over
the distribution I decided to include a node locking routine. The node locking gives me
better contact to the user community. The license key you get can only be used on the
computer that generated the unlock code.

When you start KipTool the first time, an activation dialog will appear. Klick the Register button and your default web browser will appear on the registration page. Enter the requested information and don't forget to select KipTool as the application otherwise the wrong key will be generated.

\chapter{A first example}
KipTool has a number of register tabs for different tasks. In the data part there are four tabs; Project information, Data, Processing
\section{Project information}
The project information tab is used to add information about the current processing task mainly for documentation purposes. You don't have to enter any information here but it can be helpful when you are trying to find out what you did when you return to the data at later time.

\section{Load the data}
To select and load the data you have to provide the full path and file mask in the dedicated field on the top of the data tab. This can be done with help of the browse button which provides a file selection dialog. Navigate to the data and select any file in the data set you want to load and press choose. The correct file mask now appears in the entry field. The file mask is made of a base name (including the path) followed by a number of \#'s to match the file index numbers, \emph{eg.} \verb+slice_####.tif+. KipTool can for the moment only read tiff images. Once you have the file mask you have to select the interval of files using the numeric entries for the first and last image. There is also the possibility to skip files by changing the file increment from 1 to the desired increment number. Now you can press the Load data button and the data is loaded and displayed in the original image viewer. Using the slider below the images you can inspect the loaded data. For this example it is sufficient to load ten slices. 

If the data is too large you can mark a region in the original image viewer and press the ROI button. This will transfer the ROI coordinates to the ROI entries. Now set the check mark for use ROI and then press Load data again to reload the data.
 
\section{Select processing modules}
KipTool works with a set of processing modules that process the image in a sequence. These modules are inserted and configured under the processing tab. When you start KipTool for the first time, the process chain is empty. To add a module press Add to the left in the module configurator, figure \ref{fig_moduleconfigurator}. A file dialog that asks you to select a module library appears, select the AdvancedFilterModules library.

\end{figure}
Select the ISS filter in the drop-down and press OK. The module now appears in the list to the left in the Module configurator, to the right you see the parameters that are used by the module. You can repeat the add module to insert more modules if you like. If the order of the modules are wrong, you can drag them in the list to rearrange the order.

\section{Start processing and inspect the results}
When the data is loaded and at least one module is configured you can start the processing by going to the Process menu and select Process. The processing starts and when it is completed the result is displayed in the image viewer for processed data. When you now drag the slider below the viewers you can inspect the images in parallel.  

\section{Save the processed data}
When the processing is complete you probably want to save the results to disk. Select the data tab again and enter destination path using the browse button and enter the file mask using \#'s as place holders for the index numbers, exceeding \#'s will be filled with zeros. When you press save the data will be saved in the same format as the original data. You can however also select a different format by using the drop-down for file formats. 

\chapter{Detailed description}
\section{Processing modules}
There are many modules available for KipTool. Unfortunately many are also under development which means that they can crash the software or are very slow. The modules that are documented here are well tested and will work.
\subsection{The ISS filter}
The Inverse Scale Space Filter is a an edge preserving de-noising filter based on the paper \cite{burger2006}. The filter solves the differential equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{du}{dt}&=&\frac{\nabla\cdot \nabla u}{|\nabla u|} + \lambda(u-f-v)\nonumber\\
\frac{dv}{dt}&=&\alpha (u-v)
\end{eqnarray}
using an iterative solver on the discrete equations. Here the solution time $T=N\cdot\tau$ can be selected using number of iterations, $N$, and time increments, $\tau$. For stability reasons it is important that the value of $\tau$ is less than 0.125.

\chapter{Continued development}
Kiptool is continuously developing to adapt to new challenges at the neutron
imaging beamlines at Paul Scherrer Institut. Unfortunately, it is not only new
development but also bug fixing. To fix bug the input from users is important,
so I kindly ask you to report problems when the software misbehaves.

For the continued development it also important with feedback regarding
improvements of existing and new features. So, if you have any comments that you
would like to share I appreciate if you send them to me. I cannot promise that I
will implement everything but I will at least consider it.
